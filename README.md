# 🎬 Moviees – For Curious Movie Lovers
(*The double "e" is intentional — because one "e" just wasn’t enough for movie lovers.*)

A fullstack movie app for people who love to discover, collect, and share films — built to explore secure authentication, database modeling, and smooth search UX.

## 🌟 About the Project

**Moviees** is a solo-developed movie library app built with **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, **Supabase**, and **Prisma**.  
It was designed to practice *end-to-end* product thinking — from **secure Google login and database schema design** to **API integration and frontend UX**.

It allows users to:

- 🔍 **Search** and browse movies with responsive filtering  
- 💬 **Review** films (privately or publicly)  
- ❤️ **Favorite & collect** titles into personal lists  
- 🔐 **Login with Google** for a personalized experience  
- 📣 **Share public profiles** with friends

### 🧠 UX–Data Flow Highlights *(Bridging interface design and backend logic)*

- Focused on **clear search experience** — minimal friction, responsive design
- Designed **Next.js API routes** with Prisma for structured Postgres data access
- Integrated **Supabase** as a scalable backend for authentication and storage
- Managed **user sessions** and secure Google login with NextAuth
- Balanced **data modeling** with **clean, intuitive UI**

This project demonstrates my approach to **connecting UI design with API and database architecture** to deliver usable, maintainable fullstack apps.
